rails c --sandbox 
# This lets you create a sandbox console environment. The db records created during this session will be removed upon exiting the session. 

rails routes -c posts

# This will make sure that when user clicks on Time Entries, it goes to Posts page wherever posts_path takes it

bundle exec rake db: setup
# Runs the seeds file and overwrites the dev Database with seed data


def show
        @post = Post.find(params[:id])
end
# Always remember to create the instance in controller method before calling it in view 

# show.html.erb
<%= @post.inspect %>

#And then you render that nav bar using embedded ruby in application.html.erb
